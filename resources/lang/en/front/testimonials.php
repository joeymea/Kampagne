Suddenly, not only was all the information nicely organised in their respective locations but it also looked really really good at the same time! I can see how it impacted my game aswell because having all these notes backed up by an actual calendar made everything seem so much more grounded and real. Finally, seeing players going through entries trying to figure out a mystery and how invested they had gotten was one of the most satisfying things in my DMing career!',
